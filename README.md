🔐 Authentication Flow
Register → User creates account
Hash Password → Password hashed with bcrypt
Generate JWT → Token issued on login
Store Token → Saved in localStorage (web) / AsyncStorage (mobile)
Attach to Requests → Token sent in Authorization header
Verify Token → Backend validates on protected routes
Auto Logout → Token expires based on JWT_EXPIRE setting
🎯 Smart Suggestions Logic
Suggestions are automatically generated based on mood type:

// Backend: src/utils/suggestions.js
Happy     → "Keep spreading positivity..."
Sad       → "Try deep breathing exercises..."
Angry     → "Take a walk to cool off..."
Anxious   → "Use the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique..."
Neutral   → "Take time to reflect on your day..."
Excited   → "Channel this energy productively..."
Tired     → "Your body is telling you it needs rest..."
⚠️ Emergency Alert Feature

Update REACT_APP_API_URL if needed
Mobile app won't connect
Solution: Same UI  but use http://10.0.2.2:5000 for Android emulator
Or ensure device is on same network as backend
Token expired
Solution: Logout and login again
Adjust JWT_EXPIRE in backend .env
